1: printf() is using %lf, thus expecting a double, thus, as there is no 
double, the default value is 0.0 etc

2: printf() is not passed an integer to utilize with the %d placeholder, 
thus the default value of 0

3: printf() is being passed a double with a %d, integer, placeholder, 
thus resulting in erroneous output
